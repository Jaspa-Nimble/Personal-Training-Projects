# Module 01 — Malware Concepts & Analysis

**Module summary:** High-level overview of malware types, how they are classified, how defenders detect and analyze malicious artifacts, and legal/ethical considerations.

**Learning objectives**
- Understand common malware families and characteristics (trojans, viruses, worms, spyware).
- Learn defensive approaches: detection signatures, behavior-based detection, sandboxing, and network indicators.
- Practice safe analysis of malicious samples in a controlled, isolated environment (analysis only — no deployment).

**Module contents**
- [`module-01/Exercise-01.md`](— Exercise 1): "Create a Trojan to Gain Access to the Target System" (note: conceptual/analysis only).
- [`module-01/Exercise-02.md`](— Exercise 2): "Create a Virus to Infect the Target System" (note: conceptual/analysis only).
- [`module-01/Exercise-03.md`](— Exercise 3): "Create a Worm using the Internet Worm Maker Thing" (note: conceptual/analysis only).
- [`module-01/Exercise-04.md`](— Exercise 4): "User System Monitoring and Surveillance using Spytech SpyAgent" (note: conceptual/analysis only).
- [`module-01/Exercise-05.md`](— Exercise 5): "Find Vulnerabilities on Exploit Sites" (note: vulnerability research with permissions and ethics).

## How to approach these exercises (SAFELY)
- Use this module to **document**: objectives, hypothesis, observed behavior, detection signatures, mitigation strategies, and ethical/legal notes.
- If you analyze malware samples, do so using **air-gapped VMs / sandbox environments** and follow your institution's policy.
- Do **not** publish exploit code, weaponized scripts, or step-by-step malware instructions in this public repo. If you must retain artifacts, keep them private and access-controlled.

## Deliverables for Module 01
- Lab report for each exercise with: Overview, Tools used (non-actionable), Observations, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), Detection/Mitigation recommendations, References.
