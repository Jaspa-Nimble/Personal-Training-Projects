# Exercise 01 — (Conceptual) Trojan: Gain Access to Target System
**Status:** Draft

> **Safety reminder:** This page describes the learning goals and analysis approach only. It does **not** provide code or step-by-step instructions to create malware.

## Overview 
A Trojan is wrapped within or attached to a legitimate program, implying that the program may have functionality that is not apparent to
the user. Furthermore, attackers use victims as unwitting intermediaries to attack others. They can use a victim’s computer to commit illegal
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
A compromised system can affect other systems on the network. Systems that transmit authentication credentials such as passwords over
shared networks in clear text or a trivially encrypted form are particularly vulnerable. If an intruder compromises a system on such a network,
they may be able to record usernames and passwords or other sensitive information. Additionally, a Trojan, depending on the actions it performs,
may falsely implicate a remote system as the source of an attack by spoofing, causing a liability to the remote system. Trojans enter a system
by means such as email attachments, downloads, and instant messages.
The lab tasks in this exercise demonstrate how easily hackers can gain access to the target systems in an organization and create a covert
communication channel for transferring sensitive data between the victim computer and the attacker.

Hence, security professionals must have the required knowledge of information security threats and vulnerabilities to safeguard the organization’s
sensitive data against unauthorized access or theft.

## Learning objectives
